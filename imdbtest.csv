Whatever case, situations change fast speed Tetsur?Ÿ?? meets important characters story mostly pure chance. feel makers either left something include extra 30 minutes. <br /><br />However, there's arguing GE999 deserved place anime classic. animation itself, faithful style Matsumoto's manga, detailed beautiful watch.

Guncrazy movie speaks disenfranchised lot better movie, see instead.<br /><br />No normal kid would Trent does. State Troopers work film etc. Seeing movie makes realize writers use hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. Mija completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes, terrible life. However, terrible person audience cannot identify her.<br /><br />Usually one thing movie recommended for, case none. ridiculous movie insults person tries identify main characters. acting adequate B-movie standards direction presents nothing new interesting.",0

Sniper uses classic movie formula, many dismiss immediately flawing movie. sniper reflect 100% truth country's Military Snipers work, give know nothing Professional Sniper glimpse world Sniper. yes, movie many flaws, movie doesn't? many good scenes good acting Tom Berenger. say 2 worst scenes beginning movie Billy Zane Helicopter followed Zane Marine's bar scene. best scene Sniper Berenger middle field opposing force sweeping it!!
